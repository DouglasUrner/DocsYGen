### C4U Generator / Updater

Given a configuration file that describes a set of lessons:

* If the document does not already exist, create a new one and edit the configuration file toinclude the document ID so that further updates can be made to the same file (thus updating Google Classroom).
* If the document does exist, get the original (using document ID) and replace its contents.
